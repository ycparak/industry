# Industry14
A marketplace connecting programmers looking for jobs with companies looking to statistically find the best ones. Built as a serverless app with React, Redux &amp; Firestore.

## Goal
This was my final year university project. Here’s what I wrote as an intro to my project:
> We help programmers find great companies to work at and help companies find great programmers. We test programmers on their actual coding ability, generating a statistical report on their strengths & weaknesses. This report helps companies quickly assess candidates on objective metrics rather than subjective resumes. Companies can contact, interview and extend offer letters to programmers all through our online platform.

## Goal
To run it:
1. Clone the repo
2. In the root directory, from your command line, run `npm start`
3. The app should be running at `http://localhost:3000`

## Screenshots
As you log in as a company, this is your home page.
